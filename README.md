# CIS-106-Robert-P.
Hello, my name is Robert P. I have joined this class to begin my journey as a Cybersecurity Engineer, I was told this class was a good first step. To understand why I am in this class is to understand why I have chosen said career path, to which there is an answer as simple as breathing air. Said answer boils down to good finance, I will have guaranteed security in a field that can only evolve and grow rather than deplete and become obsolete. That is all, nothing more and nothing less. Thank you for your time, I hope you have a wonderful day today and tomorrow along with many more ahead.
